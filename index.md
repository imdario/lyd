Lýd is not a brand new software. Lýd is a modifiable blueprint. It describes what is needed to build a working horizontal organization. Even under weak cohesion circumstances.

If you use Lýd as guideline, please explain me, [Dario Castañé](http://dario.im), which tools and practices you adopt and develop.

Lýd doesn't exist in a intellectual void. It stands on the shoulders of giants as [Rick Falkvinge's Swarmwise](http://falkvinge.net/2013/03/01/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-two/), [James S. Fishkin's deliberative democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy), [Alvin Toffler's adhocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy), etc.
