# Nexus

> Groups based on shared characteristics. A workgroup, territorial unit, knowledge subject, etc.

Peer networks are not planned but we can help them to grow. What is the most important? Proximity.

How do we achieve this without planning? In LÃ½d, groups based on shared characteristics of their members.

What kind of characteristcs? Let's see:

* Town (and any other territorial division).
* Language
* Profession
* Interests
* etc.

Any members' information can be used as nexus, createad automatically.

Nexus aren't limited to characteristics. You can create *ex profeso* nexus that will be shared by members, for workgroups, committees, etc.

Nexus act as sets. You can join them by sharing a [flow](/flow) (they are joined only from this flow's point of view), intersect them to get specialized nexus (e.g. communication team for a city), etc.

## Transparency

Nexus must be accessible to anyone unless legal issues exist in some groups. E.g. HHRR nexus in some countries must be only accessed by people under NDA agreements.

## Privacy

Members can choose how they want to be seen.
