Lýd -- Liquid Organization Foundation
=====================================

> lýð- _/ˈliːð-/_ from Icelandic, "people" (or related with). lýður: public, popular; lýðræði: democracy.

Lýd is about human communication around decision-making processes and liquid democracy. We want to provide tools for open, democratic and self-organized social groups of all sizes and types (NGOs, assemblies, political parties, city councils, parliaments, etc).

Standing on [liquid democracy](http://communitywiki.org/LiquidDemocracy) principles, Lýd aims to empower organizations with crowdsourcing means and to provide a flexible platform for anyone who wants to build upon it.

This is an initiative of [Dario Castañé](http://dario.im), [Pirates de Catalunya](http://pirata.cat) CTO's, started just one year from the creation of the party. This is my way to celebrate our birthday :) If you want to join us, just contact me at dario (at) pirata (dot) cat. We are open to anybody!

## Status
Currently I'm working on the initial analysis, which I'm going to work in this wiki in the next weeks. If you feel curious, I'm only able to tell you this right now: just imagine a mashup between [IdeaTorrent](http://ideatorrent.org/), [LiquidFeedback](http://liquidfeedback.org/open-source/) and [BetterMeans](http://bettermeans.com/). That doesn't mean that we are going to do again the wheel. LiquidFeedback is a great foundation for Lýd, for example.
