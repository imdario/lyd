				<h1>Delegation</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>from liquid democracy, leadership based in trust and non-blocking decision making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trust">Trust</a>:</strong> assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.</p>

<p><strong>Non-blocking:</strong> using trust as shared base, members take decisions further with delegated votes on them, in public backlogs available to any member (even anonymous if desired).</p>

<h2>Horizontality and cooperation</h2>

<p>Any member can be delegate and can delegate on other member, always by nexus. Members can opt out from being delegates. Delegation is not mandatory and it must be renewed.</p>

<p>General delegation is possible but it only has effect in nexus where both (delegate and delegating) are members. Main reason behind this is you must follow a nexus activity to be able to take decisions and as a way to audit delegates.</p>

<p>Delegation is transitive. Final delegates (they don’t delegate) have one vote with equal weight to their total delegations.</p>

<p>Based on decision’s priority, it must be stated when voting is started, delegating have a previously configured time lapse to cast their opposition vote. Each oppostion vote subtract one unit of delegate’s weight vote.</p>

<p>Casting an opposition vote doesn’t permanently revoke delegation. An opposition vote works only for one voting.</p>

<p>In workgroups, based on total delegations, member with highest number will be lýder. This can be used as a way to determine who is the coordinator in a flexible way.</p>

<p>New nexus created by union, intersection, etc. from other nexus can be done with an automatic delegation recalculation from other nexus to allow immediate coordination and action.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>Members know what their delegates vote. Based on voting’s priority, they will be able to cast an opposition vote.</p>

<p>Number of delegations on a delegate will be always available. Current weight for a given voting will be detailed.</p>

<p>Closing a voting won’t happen before last delegate voting. A delegate can only vote before the minimum time lapse needed for its delegating. This will be published along the voting and handled automatically by the system.</p>

<p>Total votes (for, against, abstention) will be summarized and published in a public (for members or everybody) backlog outside the nexus. If a decision is not published in the backlog, it is void.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and privacy</h2>

<p>Delegates votes are only known by them and who delegate on them. Only summarized results will be published.</p>

<p>Any member can check delegates and decisions for a given nexus. This information must be accessible to any member, independently of bieng inside the nexus or not.</p>
