				<h1>Flow</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>anything which exists inside an organization in any time span. E.g. projects, conversations, tasks, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our dairy activity we are surrounded by conversations. Discussions. Debates. You name it.</p>

<p>A flow can be anything (based on its type) and it can last any amount of time (from forever to just minutes).</p>

<p>A flow has:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Original message:</strong> message starting the flow. It has a subject (a.k.a. title).</li>
<li>
<strong>Nexus:</strong> one or more nexus where a flow belongs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Messages:</strong> discussion’s messages. A message can only belong to one flow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type:</strong> given a type, a flow acquires additional features: voting, edition, history, discussion turn, etc. A flow has only one type. A type can combine other types.</li>
<li>
<strong>Parent Flow:</strong> from which flow comes. It is not mandatory for standalone flows.</li>
<li>
<strong>Related Flows:</strong> flows that interact with another flow. Useful to track merged flows.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Horizontality</h2>

<p>Every member has equal rights over a flow based on nexus’ settings.</p>

<p>They can reply to the original message. Any flow must allow replies.</p>

<p>In order to keep as much context and structure as possible, anyone can modify a flow (unless opposite is stated) with actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fork:</strong> from a given message, create a new flow. The new flow can have a new type. At source it is linked, in forked message, and at destiny, source is destiny flow’s parent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Merge:</strong> create a new flow, from two other flows, with an unified collection of messages and an optional new original message.</li>
<li>
<strong>Relate:</strong> link it with another flow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mute:</strong> for a given user, she won’t receive notifications nor see it again.</li>
</ul>

<p>This actions keep debate structured and avoid off-topics to take over main conversation. They also allow to manage duplication and information overload.</p>

<h2>Transparency, accessibility and privacy</h2>

<p>Transparency and privacy come from nexus’ settings where a flow belongs.</p>

<p>Flows must be accessible with permalink, as long as each message they contain.</p>

<h2>Cooperation</h2>

<p>To simplify cooperation and discussion, common answers like agreement or rejection must be handled through specific mechanisms like +1/-1 buttons on messages.</p>

<p>Flows can be used to receive external feedback from different sources, like requests, criticism, press contacts, searches and mentions in social networks, leaks, ideas, etc.</p>

<p>A REST API is mandatory to allow third party integration. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn">Huginn</a> integration for IFTTT-like features.</p>
